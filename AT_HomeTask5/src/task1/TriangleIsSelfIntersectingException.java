public class TriangleIsSelfIntersectingException extends Exception{
//	Disclaimer!
//	To be quite honest I can't understand how triangle can be self-intersecting. 
//	It has only 3 vertexes. The sides of the triangle can only intersect at the vertices. But I have the task. 
//	So I decided to assume that the exception will come when all 3 vertices of the triangle lie on the same line (or match)
//	I do not think that this situation is critical for calculating the area - the area will simply be equal to 0...
//	but I have no choice
